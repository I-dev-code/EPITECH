## [First_year: Projects](./1ft_year/Projects): **Advanced C projects**
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

- [C GRAPHICAL PROGRAMMING](./1ft_year/Projects/C_Graph_Prog): **Projects with CSFML (lib graphical)**
  * [Subects](./1ft_year/Projects/C_Graph_Prog/Subects): Purpose of this unit is to make fun and functional games.<p></p>
  - [My_hunter](./1ft_year/Projects/C_Graph_Prog/my_hunter): Game made with CSFML librairie based on the famous duck hunt game.
  - [My_runner](./1ft_year/Projects/C_Graph_Prog/my_runner): Game with a scrolling camera in which the character must stay, while dodging obstacles. It's a endless running game.
  - [My_defender](./1ft_year/Projects/C_Graph_Prog/my_defender): Game based on tower defense game (clash royals, plants vs zombies...)<p></p>
  
- [ELEMENTARY_PROGRAMMING_IN_C](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C): **Projects in C language**
  * [Subects](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C/Subects): Purpose of this unit is to understand C language with algorithms.<p></p>
  - [The BSQ](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C/BSQ): Algorithm which find biggest square in a given map with obstacles.
  - [The Dante's star](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C/Dante_star): Algorithm generating perfect or not maze. + Algorithm to solve the making maze.
  - [The GetNextLine](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C/GetNextLine): Making my own version of the getline function.
  - [The Lem-in](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C/Lem-in): Lem-in is an algorithmic project focusing on graphs. The goal is to reproduce the behaviours of an ant farm manager.
  - [The Matchstick](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C/Matchstick): A little, simple game in which taking matches is enough to win....at least in theory.
  - [The Pushswap](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C/Pushswap): Learning data sorting, yes, but also as quickly as possible!
