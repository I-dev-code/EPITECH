## [First year: Projects](./1ft_year/Projects): **Advanced C projects**
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

- [C GRAPHICAL PROGRAMMING](./1ft_year/Projects/C_Graphical_Prog): **Projects with CSFML (lib graphical)**
  * [Subects](./1ft_year/Projects/C_Graphical_Prog/Subjects): Purpose of this unit is to make fun and functional games.<p></p>
  - [My_hunter](./1ft_year/Projects/C_Graphical_Prog/my_hunter): Game made with CSFML librairie based on the famous duck hunt game.
  - [My_runner](./1ft_year/Projects/C_Graphical_Prog/my_runner): Game with a scrolling camera in which the character must stay, while dodging obstacles. It's a endless running game.
  - [My_defender](./1ft_year/Projects/C_Graphical_Prog/my_defender): Game based on tower defense game (clash royals, plants vs zombies...)
  
- [ELEMENTARY_PROGRAMMING_IN_C](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C): **Projects in C language**
  * [Subects](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C/Subjects): Purpose of this unit is to understand C language with algorithms.<p></p>
  - [The BSQ](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C/BSQ): Algorithm which find biggest square in a given map with obstacles.
  - [The Dante's star](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C/Dante_star): Algorithm generating perfect or not maze. + Algorithm to solve the making maze.
  - [The GetNextLine](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C/GetNextLIne): Making my own version of the getline function.
  - [The Lem-in](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C/Lem-in): Lem-in is an algorithmic project focusing on graphs. The goal is to reproduce the behaviours of an ant farm manager.
  - [The Matchstick](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C/Matchstick): A little, simple game in which taking matches is enough to win....at least in theory.
  - [The Pushswap](./1ft_year/Projects/Elementary_Programming_C/Pushswap): Learning data sorting, yes, but also as quickly as possible!
 

- [INTRODUCTION_TO_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE](./1ft_year/Projects/Intro_to_AI) **Project in C language, discovering world of Artificial Inteligency**
  * [Subject](./1ft_year/Projects/Intro_to_AI/Subject): Purpose of thiis unit is to simulating an autonomous car.<p></p>
  - [Need4Stek](./1ft_year/Projects/Intro_to_AI/Need4Stek): create my own autonomous car. It's capable
of driving on a track without hitting the walls or driving in the wrong direction.

- [SHELL_PROGRAMMING](./1ft_year/Projects/Shell_Programming) **Project in C language, making is own shell**
  * [Subjects](./1ft_year/Projects/Shell_Programming/Subjects): Purpose of this unit is to make is own shell with basic command and all features we can<p></p>
  - [Minishell2](./1ft_year/Projects/Shell_Programming/minishell2): First step for a entire minishell, with basic command, pipe, dup...
  - [42sh](./1ft_year/Projects/Shell_Programming/42sh): Final shell.

- [UNIX_SYSTEM_PROGRAMMING](./1ft_year/Projects/Unix_System_Programming) **All the fundamental elements of UNIX programming**
  * [Subjects](./1ft_year/Projects/Unix_System_Programming/Subjects): Know how to execute system calls and be capable of solving algorithmic problems.<p></p>
  - [Navy](./1ft_year/Projects/Unix_System_Programming/Navy): You must code a terminal version of the Navy. The two players comunicate using the signals SIGUSER1 and SIGUSER2
  - [Tetris](./1ft_year/Projects/Unix_System_Programming/Tetris): The goal of this project is to recreate the Tetris game in a UNIX terminal, with the Gameboy version rules, with ncurses lib.
  - [ls command](./1ft_year/Projects/Unix_System_Programming/my_ls): Recode the ls [-lRdrt] [FILE] command.
  - [printf command](./1ft_year/Projects/Unix_System_Programming/my_printf): Recode the printf function from the C library according to the C99 standard. 
  - [sokoban](./1ft_year/Projects/Unix_System_Programming/my_sokoban): Develop a copy of the japanese game, in terminal mode with ncurses lib.

## **Second year in progress...**
